# Mobilook

Mobilook is a WordPress plugin that provides a mobile-oriented preview of content directly inside the editor.

It is designed to help editors and site owners visually inspect readability, layout, and content hierarchy in a mobile context before publication.


## Purpose

A large portion of web traffic is mobile.
However, content is often created and reviewed primarily on desktop screens.

Mobilook exists to reduce this gap by exposing a mobile-focused reading perspective during the editorial process.


## Core behavior (high level)

– Displays content in a mobile-style viewport inside the editor.
– Focuses on readability and content flow.
– Does not alter content or front-end rendering.
– Operates as a visual inspection aid, not an optimization engine.


## What this plugin is not

– Not a responsive design framework.
– Not a mobile performance optimizer.
– Not a SEO plugin.
– Not a content rewriting tool.
